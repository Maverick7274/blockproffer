# Things a Voting System needs :

* Secure voter registration and authentication: A system that ensures that only eligible voters can register and that their identities are verified before they can cast their vote.

* Transparency: A system that allows voters to see how their vote was counted and that their vote was recorded correctly.

* Accessibility: A system that allows voters to cast their vote from any location, whether in person, by mail, or online.

* Security: A system that prevents hacking, tampering, or other forms of malicious interference with the voting process.

* Audibility: A system that allows for independent audits and recounts of the vote to ensure accuracy and integrity of the results.

* Privacy: A system that keeps voter information confidential and protected from unauthorized access or disclosure.

* Reliability: A system that is designed to withstand technical failures and other disruptions, ensuring that votes are recorded and counted correctly.

* Voter education and information: A system that provides voters with clear and accurate information about the voting process, including how to register, where to vote, and what to expect on election day.

* Voter feedback and complaint resolution: A system that allows voters to provide feedback on their voting experience and to report any issues they encounter, with a mechanism for resolving complaints in a timely and effective manner.

* Voter accessibility: A system that makes voting accessible to all citizens including individuals with disabilities, elderly or low-literate citizens.

# Things We Need to Do :

* Research and familiarize yourself with blockchain technology and how it can be used for voting.

* Choose a blockchain platform such as Ethereum or EOS to build the app on.

* Create a smart contract that will handle the voting process, including creating the ballot, counting votes, and verifying voter identity.

* Build the front-end of the app using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

* Connect the front-end of the app to the smart contract using web3.js, a JavaScript library that allows for interaction with the blockchain.

* Implement security measures such as encryption and two-factor authentication to ensure the integrity of the voting process.

* Test the app extensively to ensure it is functioning properly and securely.

* Deploy the app to a decentralized platform such as IPFS or Swarm for decentralization.

* Continuously monitor and maintain the app to ensure its security and reliability.

* Educate the users about the app, its features and the usage of the same.
